# Usability Observation Notes

## **Adam** (I was administering this session)
Doesn't go shopping a ton, although maybe once a week at a big-store

Does not use phone when shopping

Correctly identified the app and its various features.

Had some confusion on account creation.

Confusion on home page button (and how it went to the home page)

Completed all tasks fairly easily

Difficulty finding Route (first went to Maps section)
- When probed, said it was confusing that the static maps and route were different, perhaps a link between the two would be good 

## **Levi** 
Title is broken up on a line

Identifies Home, Account Page etc

Home page button on home page is confusing

Identifies map button
	Clicks to find the wooster walmart map
	
Far bottom right button is a bit confusing for what it means
	-Able to add item to cart

Account Page Found Well

Shopping Cart -> Favorite items makes sense

Trying to find route, went to static map page

Route on map button found at bottom of shopping page a smidge confusing

## **Yasmine**
Quite experienced with shopping, spends time shopping

Bag with hearts is a bit confusing 
- Wish list?
- Favorites?
	
Search bar for items works just fine

Finding add items, account creation found fine

Adding favorite items a bit confusing as to if added already or not (cost of figma not being perfect)

Route on map confusing wording

Checkout instead of "route"
- Arises from confusion of a list, shopping cart, etc.
