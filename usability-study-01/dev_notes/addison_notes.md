#Notes for Usability Testing

##Adam: 
Very Rarely
King Supers or Whole foods
30min-45min
Very comfortable using mobile apps
Has not used phone to aid in shopping

My shopping should be together
Home button makes sense
Assumes account icon is a profile page
Not sure what map type thing is at the bottom
Understands most of the icons

Making a shopping list
Directions to a certain store location
Not a lot of space between shopping list items
If I want to take off an item or delete an item, will I be able to

Im looking for a Walmart first so I will click on location Wooster Walmart, looking for the electronics section (was able to complete the task
Went to the cart, added fertilizer to item, confused as to why there is a banana in the cart already, favorite items, no change to the numbers in our cart though
I guess I gotta click the account icon, went back to the home page, can’t scroll, cannot type in the username, there should be a button to create account
Would go to search bar, then search banana, wants a notification that the item did go to the favorites page
Going to map button, seems to be a dropdown menu nope nevermind, went to cart button, then clicked map my route
When he looked at the map he thought there would be directions, Worried about having to select a store and that the one he was already on would change, What if I don’t like google maps and want to use apple maps


##Yasmine: 
Once a month
The mall or online
A lot of hours
Very good experience with mobile apps
Writes keywords for what she is looking for

Understood the buttons for the most part (bag with heart was confusing, could be wishlist or favorite items)

Found the map very easily
Was able to search for it and add it to the cart
Found where to make an account
Was able to add item to favorite
Struggled to get a routing, 

Wording was confusing, not something that is typically in other maps which is why it was confusing
Just have checkout instead of mapping
