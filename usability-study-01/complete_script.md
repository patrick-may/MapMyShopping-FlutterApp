# Script:
Hello, ________. My name is ________, and I will be facilitating this usability testing session.
Before we begin properly, I have some background information to give you. As you may already know, we are here to have people try to use our mobile application to see if it works as the designers intended. 

Some general background information about our product is as follows:

#### *Background*
MapMyShopping is an application with the goal to make your shopping experience more fun and efficient. Most main features will be standard such as looking up or adding items to your cart. Saving favorite items and making lists. Our revolutionary main feature will be the navigation portion. We hope to achieve a navigation system that, given a shopping list for a store, will route you through that store in a way that is quick and makes sense. 

If you have any questions as we work through this usability testing, please ask. You may notice that we are recording this session. With your consent, we will record the audio and screen activity of this session to be used internally for improving our project. Other designers may be observing this session in another room as well.

Are you okay with us recording this session? [They should say yes, if not, fire them]

Do you have any questions before we continue?
(Answer questions)

Before we get to our application, I have a few questions for you.
- How often do you go shopping?
- Where do you usually go shopping? 
- How much time do you spend shopping at each of these places?
- What is your experience level with mobile apps?
- Have you used your phone to aid in shopping? 
	- if so, how have you used your phone?

Thank you for your responses. Now we will begin looking at our application. 

Try to talk through your reactions to the home page of our website. Look at this page and tell me your thoughts about it. Don’t click on anything just yet! [hand participant phone with prototype loaded to home screen]

*(Questions below necessary if participant needs probing)*
- What strikes you about it?
- What can you do here? (i.e., “what do the buttons do?”)
- What can the app be used for?

(Above questions are Home Page Tour)

Next, we will give you some scenarios to try in the app.

Please, talk through your process as much as possible. Try to think out loud as you go along. Additionally, if you have any questions, please ask.

(Give scenarios)
Thank you for participating in this usability test. 
- (Probe here if necessary) “Tell me more about what you were thinking ….”

Are there any other questions or comments you would like to make now that the test is over?

Thank you for your participation. Feel free to reach out if any further thoughts appear later.
