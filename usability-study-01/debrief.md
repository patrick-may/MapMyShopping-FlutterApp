# Debrief

## Summary
There was some confusion on the icons. Buttons for actions were not as clear to users and they should be more eye catching. 
All users were able to complete the tasks.
No users were confused on what the function of our app was.


## Ranked Issues
1. Confusing Icons
2. Action Buttons(buttons that will have functions behind them such as creating a route) were not clear.
3. Home page was confusing(too much information being displayed).
4. Change home button when on the home page.
5. Items should show aisle number and department in cart.
6. Take out favorite items page
