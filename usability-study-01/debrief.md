# Debrief

## Summary
There was some confusion on the icons. Buttons for actions were not as clear to users and they should be more eye catching. 
All users were able to complete the tasks.
No users were confused on what the function of our app was.


## Ranked Issues
1. Confusing Icons
1. Fixing Shopping Cart and Lists
2. Action Buttons(buttons that will have functions behind them such as creating a route) were not clear.
3. Home page was confusing(too much information being displayed).
4. Items should show aisle number and department in cart.
5. Take out favorite items page

# Resolution Ideas
### Confusing Icons:
Tweak existing icons. To start, change *search* icon to just a magnifying glass. When developing navigation bar at the bottom, we plan to have a couple different options to cycle through and possibly test various icons on users.

### Fixing Shopping Cart/List
Shopping cart and lists are confusing. We plan to remove the idea of a "shopping cart" in lieu of something like an "active list" that is the current shopping list, as we saw confusion on "checking out" the shopping cart. When adding items, users will select which list to add items to, and when routing, they will select a list to view a route of.

### Action Buttons:
More clarity on which buttons will take one to a new page. We plan to do this with some consistent signifier. When developing the *route* button, we will make it larger and more clear as well.

### Home Page Confusion
Display less information (remove the map area) on home-page. Display only 3 most recent lists on home page.

Signify the home button is *on* the home page.

### More information on Items
Whenever we are displaying items the user searched for, we should also display appropriate metadata on the item, such as:
- price
- aisle location (in selected store)
- in stock/not

If an item is not in stock, perhaps make it impossible to add to cart

### Favorite Items Page
We will solve the confusion and question of existence of the favorite items page by removing it. The Minimum-Viable-Product of this app may not have any user-account abilities, so we will deal with user-blocked tasks last.
