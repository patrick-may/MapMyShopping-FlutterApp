### Empathy Map for Zoe 
|     |     |
| ----- | ------ | 
| **Says:** |   **Thinks:** |
|“I needed the item sooner, so I went in-store to get it.” | “I thought let me go pick it up because delivery would take too long.” |
| “I ended up finding what I needed” |    “I ended up finding it but it wasn’t where you would expect hand-held vacuums to be.” |
| | “I think that if they organized where the items were better then it would have been more positive, it would have been easier to find.” |
| | “I think that the signs could change.” |
| |  “I think they should change the signs to say what foods are actually in that aisle, better organization.” |
| **Does** | **Feels** |
| “If I am looking for something I go to the aisle I need”|  “I like to shop at clearance because it is a lot cheaper.”  | “I really like clothes.” |
| “When food-shopping I snake up and down the aisles, so I see every aisle”|  “Kept seeing 45, 46, 48, but no 47” |
| “Went on the Walmart website while at the store and looked up handheld vacuum.”|  “I felt like I kept missing the aisle.” |
| “I clicked on the item and saw what aisle it was in.” |  “I was like what the heck where is 47” |
| “I follow the signs they put up in stores.”|  “The app helped me, so it was a positive experience.” |
| “I know where they won’t be so I can eliminate specific sections.” | “I feel like they could organize things better by making things closer together and not having random things next to each other.” |


### **Interviewee 2: Emma Downing**
- Makes a list of items when going to a big box store
- Ends up buying a bunch of stuff that she doesn’t need and were not on the original list.
	- When making the list, think through the organization of the store and put down various items in the order of store traversal. For example, would put down fruit and vegetables needed first if that is the first section in the store.
- Has used an app to aid in shopping before, primarily the target app.
	- Used for: checking prices, seeing in stock, finding location in the store
- Negative shopping experience: shopping when the app was down so no prices could be checked, and no scanners/price checkers were available in the store. 
- Navigate the store with: eyes > look for signs if eyes and intuition aren’t helpful. If really lost, use the app to get a specific aisle
- Problems:
	- Various prices for similar items – finding the best value
	- Better sorting of items within the store, makes it difficult to find the exact item that she is looking for.
-** Desires:**
	- More fresh/available food options to improve grocery stores.
	- Ability to check if food is expired.
